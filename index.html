    <h1>
        My Favorite Cartoon Character
    </h1>
    <h2> Tom And Jerry</h2>
    <p>Tom and Jerry are memorable charaters.

Tom and Jerry are a really famous duo. Tom is a cat and Jerry is mouse. The most unique thing about these 2 charaters is that they don't talk at all. The only way they communicate with each other is by using sign language or whispering on their ears
The slapstick humor. One of the most famous traits of Tom and Jerry. Now slapstick humor is nothing new. We seen old Disney cartoons do it and even we seen Lonney Tunes do it aswell.
the way Tom and Jerry react to their situations is hillarious. I especially love Tom's facial expressions and his situations during those slapstick moments.</p>
